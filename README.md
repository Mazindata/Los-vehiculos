US Car data listing 1000's of cars by price, condition, year, make &amp; model

## Project Description
This project aims to master crucial software engineering tasks through practice, resulting in becoming a more complete and attractive job candidate to potential employers.
We will manage a virtual environments and develop a web application to the cloud making it accessible to the public.
The dataset used for this project is made up of used car sales advertisements.

### Step 1. Getting started
- Create a GitHub account, a new git repository with a README.md file and a .gitignore file.
- Create a new Python environment and install necessary packages for processing & visualization.
- Create a Render account, link to Github and clone project's Git repository locally.
- Install VS Code and set the Python interpreter to the one used by the virtual environment. Make sure you have the necessary packages installed.

### Step 2. Download the data file
- Download the car advertisement dataset (vehicles_us.csv) or find your own dataset in a CSV format.
- Place the dataset in the root directory of the project.

### Step 3. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Create an EDA.ipynb Jupyter notebook in VS Code.
- Save the notebook in the notebooks directory of your project.
- Perform some exploratory analysis of the dataset in the notebook.
- Create histograms and scatterplots using plotly-express library.

### Step 4. Develop the web application dashboard
- Create an app.py file in the root of the project’s directory then import streamlit, pandas, and plotly.express.
- Read the dataset’s CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame adding headers, histograms and plots.
- Update the README file to contain a basic description of the project, explaining that this is a tool to simulate random events.

### Step 5. Deploy the application to Render
- To make Streamlit compatible with Render, we need to create two new files: requirements.txt and .streamlit/config.toml.
- First, we need to create the requirements.txt file. Create this new file in your project folder’s root level. Then, add the project’s required packages.
